# Robot RP Miniproject
## Description
Create a robotic arm with RP joint1 rotating in a rotational motion and joint2 moving in a prismatic motion.
We will use Python3 to create a GUI for controlling the motion of an RP robotic arm and it can be manually controlled using an encoder for joint1 and a potentiometer for joint2. Additionally, you can visualize the motion of the RP robotic arm using RViz.

    ```
## Download Repository from Github
If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that projectâ€™s directory.

* Run this Command in terminal.
```
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone  https://github.com/Awanta64/RP_MiniProject2.git
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```

## Executing program

Open new terminal window, use roslaunch run package.
